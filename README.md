# genlayer-truth-resolver
my official first genlayer smart contract
this is a Genlayer smart contract that uses AI + validator consensus to determine wether a factual claim is true or false.
## How it works
- A claim is provided at deployment
- Anyone can trigger resolution
- AI evaluates the claim
- Validators reach consensus
- Verdict is stored on-chain

## Verdict values
- 0 = unresolved
- 1 = true
- 2 = false

## Deployment
Deployed using Genlayer Studio on testnet.
